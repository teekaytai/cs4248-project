    "paragraph": "There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent . <CONCAT> The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe . <CONCAT> This fresh start came about because of three main factors . <CONCAT> Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union . <CONCAT> These superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states . <CONCAT> Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European \" civil wars \" . <CONCAT> Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way . <CONCAT> One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 . <CONCAT> Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three . <CONCAT> One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law . <CONCAT> This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \" integration \" . <CONCAT> The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies ."
