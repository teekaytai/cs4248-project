    "paragraph": "An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television . <CONCAT> TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , news , etc . <CONCAT> Now , if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening . <CONCAT> While previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is finalized . <CONCAT> As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sets means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas . <CONCAT> So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act , this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas ."
