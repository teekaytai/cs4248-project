      "This fresh start came about because of three main factors .",
      "Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .",
      "These superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .",
      "Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European \" civil wars \" .",
      "Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .",
      "One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .",
      "Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .",
